## Examples

This crate enables choosing a type based on a compile-time constant, just like
[`std::conditional_t` in C++](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/conditional).

```rust
use condtype::CondType;

let str: CondType<true,  &str, i32> = "hello";
let int: CondType<false, &str, i32> = 42;

// Unsized types are also supported:
let str: &CondType<true, str, [u8]> = "world";
```

## Limitations

It is currently not possible to use `CondType` with a generic constant, since
Rust does not yet consider trait implementations based on booleans to be
exhaustive (see [issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/project-const-generics/issues/26)).

```rust,ignore
fn generic<const B: bool>() {
    let x: CondType<B, i32, u8> = ...
}
```

## Install

This crate is [available on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/condtype) and can be
used by running the following `cargo` command in your project directory:

```sh

```

or by manually adding the following to your project's [`Cargo.toml`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html):

```toml
[dependencies]
condtype = "1.0.0"
```
